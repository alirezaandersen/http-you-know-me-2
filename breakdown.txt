things we need to do.

Main TDD. NEED TO LEARN ABOUT FARADAY!!!!

SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY - first goal!

Files -
1) WebServer        - Should only do loop nothing else!

2) Controller        - Should only deal with output,router, and diagnostic class
                      currently is good do not add more

3) Router             - Should only have Controller information case statement should
                      be 1 maybe 2 methods long

4) RESPONSE CODES   - Should be a constant as of now only needs RC

5) diagnostic class - Should be a parser that deals with responder populates
                      data info requested maybe 2 classes? or Module
    merge with 6 maybe since????
6) output_path      - Should be the output for hello, regular output(debug info),
                      valid date,turn_off(with total request), dictionary validating
                      words, unkown_path, force error

7) game             - should only be about the game.



Based on all the iterations Response Codes should have its own CONSTANTS or Modules
200 OK
301 Moved Permanently
401 Unauthorized
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
500 Internal Server Error
this can be used throughout Iterations 2-5. but the RC will always be the same thus
assign it a CONSTANT if nothing else is added to the file.

Iteration 0 - have hello world return with the number of counts
  easy to implement but changes after iteration 1.

iteration_1 - debug info - returns the results at the bottom
  each time a option is called.
  questions - should it return for terminal or server?
  should interact with constants only?

****Controller Class******
iteration_2 - seems like a Controller only - NEEDS VERY SPECIFIC PATH
needs to iterate over certain criteria's possible case statement should only
process client and requests. should do the following

    1) Hello World
    2) regular output
    3) Specific date format - fixed in responder just need to learn how to use it again
    4) word_search aka word validator
    5)

iteration_3 - parsing and comparing words. Needs to be involved with iteration_2
maybe its own file but should response to Processor and Responder? needs to process that it
validates words http://host:port/path?param=value&param2=value2 need to parse through
the dictionary on computer. /user/share/dict/words . output should equal
#{WORD}.upcase is a known word || #{WORD}.upcase is not a known word.


iteration_4 - added the game stuff to Processor. Create custom class for game.
